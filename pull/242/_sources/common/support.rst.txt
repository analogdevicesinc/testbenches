Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Analog Devices, Inc.`_ will provide **limited** online support for anyone
using the :git-testbenches:`reference design <>` with `ADI`_ components via
the :ez:`fpga` FPGA reference designs forum.

It should be noted, that the older the tools' versions and release branches
are, the lower the chances to receive support from `ADI`_ engineers.
