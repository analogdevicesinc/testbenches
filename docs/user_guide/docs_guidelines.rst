Documentation guidelines
================================================================================

This documentation is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and
all source code is available at the path :git-testbenches:`docs`.

To contribute to it, open a pull request with the changes to
:git-testbenches:`this repository </>`, just make sure to read the general
:ref:`doctools:docs_guidelines` first **and** the additional guidelines
below specific to the Testbenches repository.

Templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Templates are available:

* :git-testbenches:`docs/projects/ip_based/template` (:ref:`rendered <ip_based_template>`).
* :git-testbenches:`docs/projects/project_based/template` (:ref:`rendered <project_based_template>`).

Remove the ``:orphan:`` in the first line, it is to hide the templates from the
`TOC tree <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree>`_,
and make sure to remove any placeholder text and instructive comment.

.. note::

   The old wiki uses `dokuwiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki>`_. When
   importing text from there, consider ``pandoc`` and the tips accross the
   :ref:`doctools:docs_guidelines` to convert it to reST.

Common sections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **More information** and **Support** sections that are present in
the Testbenches documentation, are actually separate pages inserted as links.
They're located at testbenches/projects/common/more_information.rst and /support.rst,
and cannot be referenced here because they don't have an ID at the beginning
of the page, so not to have warnings when the documentation is rendered that
they're not included in any toctree.

They are inserted like this:

.. code-block::

   .. include:: ../projects/common/more_information.rst

   .. include:: ../projects/common/support.rst

And they will be rendered as sections of the page.

Warnings and messages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The warning and message directives are used for information highlighting. The
different types of warnings and messages are listed and explained on the
`Sphinx Directives documentation page <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#admonitions-messages-and-warnings>`_.

Here are a couple of examples:

.. code-block::

   .. note::

      This is a note.

   .. important::

      This is an important message!

And they will be rendered as sections of the page.

Class hierarchy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For class inheritance and aggregation hierarchy generation the
`D2 Playground <https://play.d2lang.com/>`_ is used. This is helpful when
changes need to be made to the hierarchy and the documentation is updated in the
future. The hierarchy code must include the inheritance graph and, if applicable,
the aggregation graph. All classes drawn in the graph should have a
link to the documentation that explains it. Listing properties and methods is a
nice to have, but not mandatory. The layout engine must be set to ELK. When
generating the SVG files, the inheritance graph and the aggregation graph must
be generated separately using the toolâ€™s Export SVG function. The class
hierarchy code must be saved as a .txt file and uploaded alongside the SVG
files.
